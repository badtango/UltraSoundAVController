# UltraSoundAVController
Audio visuals controlled via the use of ultrasound (ping) sensors.

This was one of two projects built for my undergraduate dissertation, which was a study of audio visuals and their relationship with gestural movement. The other was a similar project in which I designed and built a glove using flex sensors and fed the data into a modular environment called Max/MSP. 
There are six sensors placed on every side of a project container, each feeding data from an Arduino project board into supercolliders Pen, Audio Buffer and Synth classes. See the link below for video examples. I apologise for the video quality, I had no control over the setting in which these recordings took place.

There was a considerable amount of coding that took place to reach the final patch exhibited here, iâ€™ve decided to only include the final patches as this project is too laborious to navigate otherwise. This patch features six different audio visual variants each triggered by a number on the computer keypad.

Note: These patches are only functional with the aforementioned hardware.
